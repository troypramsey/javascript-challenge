# UO Data JavaScript Challenge

## Data
A collection of JavaScript objects representing various UFO sightings.

## Running the App
Executing the index file in either difficulty will directly build an initial table containing all of the values. The search bar will filter the table automatically and return a filtered table
using an event listener that fires whenever the user finishes typing a key. All JavaScript commands can be found in the app.js file in each static folder.
